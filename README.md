## Assignment 1: Choosing and describing my dataset 
My dataset is comprised of an association matrix obtained from observing a population of 24 bedbugs over the course of 6 days along with a spreadsheet describing key attributes of each individual bug such as sex and thorax width (a proxy for size). Scans were conducted between 10am - 6pm at hourly intervals. The values in the matrix represent how many times a given pair of bedbugs were observed to be within one body length of each other. With this data, I hope to explore how the presence of intense sexual conflict and sexual harassment influence female social behaviour. Because engaging in social interactions through aggregation participation is expected to be more costly for female bedbugs who require a very low mating rate to maintain maximum fecundity compared to males who benefit from multiple matings, I predict females will be less social than males. I also predict that my bedbug population will be phenotypically assorted by sex since females preferentially associating with other females may serve as a social strategy for mitigating the costs of mating while maintaining the benefits of group living. However, since I do not know how to statistically test these predictions yet, this week I decided to conduct a t-test comparing male vs. female thorax width to see if females are in fact larger than males.
