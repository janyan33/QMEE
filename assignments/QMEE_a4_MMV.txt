Assuming this population has 100 people, 1 person will have MMV and will test positive. 
Of the other 99 people, 5% will also test positive (roughly 5 people). 
That means, 6 people will test positive, but only 1/6 will actually have MMV. 
Therefore, if a random person tests positive for MMV, they only have a 16.67% chance of actually having MMV. 

JD: If you rounded off to 5 people, why are you reporting the answer to 5 significant figures.

What would I tell my friend who tested positive for MMV?

If it is the case that ALL MMD patients have an urge to make mathematical models rather than the modeling just being
a common or likely symptom, I would ask my friend if they feel the urge to make mathematical models
and observe their behaviour to see if they're making mathematical models. If not, I would tell my friend that I don't
think they have MMD because they show none of the symptoms and explain how 83% of people who test positive don't have MMD.
However, I suppose if they wanted more evidence and tests are plentiful + convenient to get, they could get tested again.  
If the friend does have a compulsory urge to create mathematical models (and this is unlike them) I think it is 
pretty fair to assume they have MMD given the fact that there isn't any other known cause for the behaviour. 
However, again, if they wanted more evidence, they can get tested again. I would tell them that if they got another test 
and tested positive, they now have an ~80% chance of having MMD because their prior probability had changed after testing
positive for the first test. If they go for a third test and test positive again, the probability that they have MMD 
would be over 99%. 

JD: Nice thoughts, but you're missing a key point. We'll discuss.
