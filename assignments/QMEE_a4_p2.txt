My hypothesis is that my bedbug populations will show assortment by sex as this could be a social strategy
employed by females to reap the benefits of aggregation without exposing themselves to unsolicited 
mating attempts from males. This is one of three predictions that I wrote in a proposal before I started 
collecting data. 

To test it, I will calculate the assortment index for each replicate using
the function assortment.discrete from the R package assortnet. The exact formula that is used
to calculate the assortment index can be found in Farine, 2014. I then intend on creating nulls models 
using data-stream permutations which will sequentially swap observations between individuals at the dyadic 
level to create new networks. I will then calculate the association index for each of these randomly generated networks 
to create a distribution that represents expected association indexes under the assumption that bedbug populations are 
not assorted by sex. I can then report on what percent of association indexes from the simulated networks is lesser
than the association index from my observed network to assess whether the observed networks are more assorted by sex 
than expected by random chance. I believe if the observed value is greater than 95% of the simulated association indexes
then my observed assortment value would be significant at p < 0.05 although I may have to adjust for multiple comparisons
if I repeat the same process with each of the 6 replicates I intend on running. This appears to be the most robust way
of testing my hypothesis but I'm still kind of unsure of it all and will have to do some more reading before attempting it.
